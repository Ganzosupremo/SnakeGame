# SnakeGame

The classic snake game, but with a little twist; There are enemies that for some reason want to end your existence... So attack them before they do. 

Navigate and survive through different levels and defeat the level's boss(es).
Different weapons to make your life easier and more effective at ending enemies' existence.
Great background music, in my humble opinion.
